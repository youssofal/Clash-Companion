# Hackathon Discipline

- 48-hour solo build. Ship a product, not a prototype.
- Design quality is a FIRST-CLASS deliverable — judges evaluate presentation alongside technical depth.
- The app must look like a funded startup product, not a weekend hack.
- Follow the milestone plan in docs/clash-companion-final-plan-v2.md
- Write complete, runnable code — no TODO stubs
- If a task exceeds 1.5x its time estimate, flag it
- The deliverable is a video demo (editable) + public GitHub repo

## Scope Triage
- MUST SHIP: Tap injection, screen capture, STT, parser, Fast Path, pHash hand detection, Queue Path, premium overlay UI, polished MainActivity
- SHOULD SHIP: Deck loading + Opus playbook, Smart Path (Gemini Flash)
- CUT IF BEHIND SAT 6 PM: Roboflow targeting + conditional triggers

## Design Is Non-Negotiable
- Every screen the judge sees must be polished: branded, animated, themed
- The overlay HUD is on camera for the ENTIRE demo video — it IS the product surface
- A beautiful app with 3 tiers beats an ugly app with 5 tiers

## Out of Scope
- Multiple games, on-device YOLO, on-device LLM, iOS
- Custom vision model training, automatic elixir reading
- Backend/database — no Supabase, keys live in local.properties

## Git Commit Standards (MANDATORY)

Judges review the commit history. Every commit must look professional and tell a clear story of incremental progress.

### Rules
1. **ONE milestone = ONE commit.** Never squash multiple milestones together.
2. **Conventional Commits format.** Every commit MUST use this structure:
3. **Imperative mood** in the subject line ("Add parser" not "Added parser").
4. **No empty commits.** Don't commit unless there are meaningful changes.
5. **Stage only relevant files.** Never commit secrets, build artifacts, or IDE files.
6. **Commit IMMEDIATELY after each milestone passes testing.** Don't batch work.

### Commit Message Format
```
feat(M#): Short imperative description of what this milestone delivers

- Bullet point: specific component/file built and what it does
- Bullet point: key technical decisions or patterns used
- Bullet point: another deliverable from this milestone
- ...list ALL significant additions, not just a summary

Tested: How this was verified (device, specific commands/actions, results)
Device: Samsung Galaxy A35, Android 16, 1080x2340
```

### Type Prefixes
- `feat` — New feature or milestone (most commits will be this)
- `fix` — Bug fix for something that was previously working
- `refactor` — Code restructuring with no behavior change
- `docs` — Documentation only (README, comments, AGENTS.md)
- `chore` — Build config, dependencies, CI, gitignore changes

### Examples of GOOD commits
```
feat(M2): On-device STT with Moonshine Base via sherpa-onnx

- SpeechService as foreground service with mic capture at 16kHz
- Silero VAD for speech endpoint detection (250ms trailing silence)
- Moonshine Base int8 offline recognition via sherpa-onnx JNI
- 300ms silence padding before/after each segment (Moonshine accuracy fix)
- Overlay "Start/Stop Listening" toggle wired to SpeechService
- sherpa-onnx Kotlin bindings: Vad, OfflineRecognizer, OfflineStream

Tested: "balloon bridge", "hog rider", "fireball" all recognized <200ms
Device: Samsung Galaxy A35, Android 16, 1080x2340
```

```
fix(M2): Correct VAD config parameter name preventing compilation

- VadModelConfig uses `sileroVadModelConfig` not `sileroVad`
- Also added missing btnMicPermission and btnSpeech to activity_main.xml

Tested: Clean build, speech service starts and transcribes successfully
Device: Samsung Galaxy A35, Android 16, 1080x2340
```

### Examples of BAD commits (NEVER do these)
- `M0+M1 - Tap injection and screen capture working` (squashed milestones, no body, no prefix)
- `fix stuff` (meaningless, no context)
- `wip` (don't commit work-in-progress)
- `update files` (says nothing about what changed or why)
